<h2 class="sans">THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Cunnin Toil.</i>)</h4>

<h3>No. VII.&mdash;THE STOLEN MARCH.</h3>

<p>I think I have already mentioned in the course of the articles
which I have consecrated to the life and exploits of <span class="sc">Picklock
Holes</span> that this extraordinary man was unmarried. There was
some mystery about certain love-making episodes in the early
stages of his career which nothing could induce him to talk about.
If I ever chanced to mention the subject of matrimony in his presence,
a hard, metallic look came over his
features, and his lips closed with
the tightness and vehemence of a
pair of handcuffs. Naturally, I was
not encouraged by these symptoms
to pursue the matter. However,
from what I have since been able
to glean from other sources, I think
I am justified in saying that <span class="sc">Holes</span>
was at one time, while quite a young
man, engaged to the daughter of
an eminent church dignitary, a
charming girl who united good looks
to a comfortable balance at her
bankers. One morning, however,
<span class="sc">Holes</span>, whose mind was constantly
occupied in the solution of deep and
complex psychological problems, suddenly
startled Miss <span class="sc">Bellasys</span> by informing her that from certain
indications he had concluded that she had two large moles on the
upper portion of her left shoulder-blade. It was in vain that the
unfortunate girl protested with tears in her eyes that she was
ignorant of this disfigurement; that, as a matter of fact, she had the
best reason for believing that no such moles existed, and that, if they
did, it was not her fault, but must be due to a momentary oversight
on the part of her nurse, a woman of excellent character and sound
church principles. <span class="sc">Holes</span> was, as usual, inexorable.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/289-450.png"><img src="images/289-300.png" width="300" height="346" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>"My dearest <span class="sc">Annabella</span>," he observed, "I am never mistaken.
Within the last ten minutes while I have been discussing with you
my new theory of clues I have noticed your left eye&mdash;the right I
cannot see&mdash;slowly close twice, while at the same moment your head
drooped on to your left shoulder. Thus you were twice blind on
the left side. Moles, as we learn, not merely from books on natural
history, but from our own observation, are blind. You have,
therefore, two moles on your left shoulder. The fact is indisputable."</p>

<p>Terrified by this convincing demonstration, poor Miss <span class="sc">Bellasys</span>
released the great detective from his engagement, and retired
shortly afterwards from the world to enrol herself in the ranks of a
nursing sisterhood.</p>

<p>These, I believe, are the facts connected with my friend's only
engagement, and I merely state them here in order that the deeply-interesting
story of his life may be as complete as laborious and
accurate research on my part can make it. It is perhaps not to be
wondered at that the man should have been to some extent soured
by the tragic termination of a love affair which seemed full of the
promise of happiness for all concerned.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that the life of <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>
was entirely destitute of the domestic joys. He would often tell
me when we met again after an interval during which he had
disappeared from my ken that he had been giving the old folks
at home a turn, and that he felt himself in a measure reinvigorated
by the simple and trusting affection lavished upon him
by his family circle. I gathered that this consisted of his father
and mother, Sir <span class="sc">Aminadab</span> and Lady <span class="sc">Holes</span>, his two younger brothers,
curiously named <span class="sc">Hayloft</span> and <span class="sc">Skairkrow Holes</span>, his widowed
sister, Mrs. <span class="sc">Gumpshon</span>, with various children of all ages left as
pledges of affection by the late Colonel <span class="sc">Gumpshon</span> of the Saltshire
Bays, as gallant an officer as ever cleft the head of an Afghan or
lopped an Egyptian in two. Often had I felt, though I had been
far too discreet to express it openly, an ardent desire to become
acquainted with a family which, if I might judge by my friend
<span class="sc">Picklock</span>, must be one of the most remarkable in the world for
brain power and keen intelligence. My wish was to be gratified
sooner than I looked for.</p>

<p>One evening, as <span class="sc">Holes</span> and I were sitting in my bachelor rooms
in Belgrave Square, there came a sudden knock at the door. We
were smoking, and I remember that <span class="sc">Holes</span> had just been explaining
to me that it was customary to infer an assassin from the
odour of Trichinopoly, whilst a Cabana denoted a man of luxurious
habits and unbridled passions. From Bird's-eye tobacco a direct
line of induction, he said, brought one to a Cabinet Minister,
whilst Cavendish in its uncut stage led to a mixture of a smuggler,
a Methodist minister, and a club-proprietor in reduced circumstances.
I was marvelling at the singular acumen of the man when,
as I say, there came a tap at the door, which interrupted our discussions.
The door then slowly opened, and a small female child, of
a preternaturally sharp expression, slid, as it were, inductively into
the room. It was the youthful <span class="sc">Isabel Gumpshon</span>, one of <span class="sc">Holes's</span>
nieces. "All right, <span class="sc">Isabel</span>," said the great detective, "we will
come with you;" and in another moment a swift four-wheeler was
conveying us to Fitzjohn's Avenue, where Sir <span class="sc">Aminadab</span> and his
lady had their dwelling-place.</p>

<p>No sooner had we arrived than I felt that we were indeed in a
home of mystery, to which the Egyptian Hall of Messrs. <span class="sc">Maskelyne</span>
and <span class="sc">Cooke</span> was a mere baby. There was in the air a heavy
odour of detection, a sort of clinging mist of inductive argument,
a vaporous emanation of crimes logically discovered and inferentially
revealed, a pervading miasma of obtuse police-inspectors
relieved by complimentary magistrates and eulogistic judges. The
description may seem highly-coloured, but it represents with
literal accuracy the impression made upon my mind by my entrance
into the ancestral mansion of the <span class="sc">Holes</span> family. Nor was this
impression removed as we ascended the stairs. On the first landing
we found Mrs. <span class="sc">Gumpshon</span> engaged in teaching her youngest boy,
<span class="sc">Augustus O'Brien Gumpshon</span>, a correct system of guess-work.
The boy, a bright little fellow of five, was at that moment in
disgrace. He had courageously attempted to guess his mother's age,
and having in an excess of rashness fixed the figure at forty-two,
he had been severely punished, and was at that moment languishing
in a corner of the landing. In the drawing-room we found the rest
of the family. Sir <span class="sc">Aminadab</span>, it appeared, had murdered the
footman some ten minutes before our arrival, and had contrived by
the aid of a pair of blood-stained braces, which were one of his most
cherished possessions, to fix the guilt upon Lady <span class="sc">Holes</span>, in whose
basket-trunk, moreover, the dismembered body of the unfortunate
menial had been discovered by the cook. The ingenuity of this
diabolical plot had for some nine minutes baffled the whole family.
Lady <span class="sc">Holes</span> was just about to resign herself to the inevitable arrest,
when <span class="sc">Hayloft Holes</span>, with an appearance of calm nonchalance,
eminently suited to his impassive features, had produced from
his father's waistcoat pocket two of the unfortunate footman's silver
buttons, and had thus convicted Sir <span class="sc">Aminadab</span> of the crime. As we
entered the drawing-room we were almost overwhelmed with the
shouts of joy that welcomed this wonderful exhibition of the family
talent. <span class="sc">Skairkrow Holes</span>, who was of a more reflective turn of
mind, had, it seemed, been looking out of the window at the
passers-by, and had just proved triumphantly to his youngest niece,
<span class="sc">Jemima</span>, that a man whom she had taken for a vendor of cat's meat
was in reality a director of a building society who had defrauded the
miserable investors of fifty-two thousand pounds, eighteen shillings,
and ninepence halfpenny. It was into this happy family party that
<span class="sc">Holes</span> and I, led by <span class="sc">Isabel Gumpshon</span>, intruded on the memorable
evening of which I speak.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>To be continued.</i>)</p>

<p class="ind">
<span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;There are, it seems, rumours about to the effect that my
marvellous friend, <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>, is dead. Some even go so far as to
assert that he never existed. I leave these two factions to fight the matter
out. If he is dead he must have existed; if he never existed he cannot have
died. This shows the folly of relying on rumour.&mdash;<span class="sc">Samuel Potson.</span>

<h2>MUSIC AND LAW.</h2>

<p>During a recent trial, Mr. <span class="sc">Edward Solomon</span>, the plaintiff
testified that his work was worth to him about thirty-nine pounds
per diem. "Why," exclaimed Mr. Justice <span class="sc">Lawrance</span>, "if you write
a good many (what?) it is better than&mdash;&mdash;" Whereupon interposed
Mr. <span class="sc">Paul Taylor</span>, Counsel for the plaintiff, "Better than the
Bar, my lord." (<i>Laughter.</i>) Why, of course, Mr. <span class="sc">Paul Taylor</span>!
Was there no one in Court with knowledge of the simplest arithmetic
sufficient to inform you that to work at <i>several bars</i> must be
worth much more than to work at <i>one Bar</i>? Hasn't Sir <span class="sc">Arthur
Sullivan</span>, by composing the lightest possible operas in the world,
achieved that best of all "possible probable" tunes, a for-tune, that
even a judge, whether of music or at law, might envy? Why,
certainly. And the <span class="sc">Gillivan-Sulbert</span> Savoyards could, if they
liked, tell Judge <span class="sc">Lawrance</span> that "thirty-nine pounds per diem"
is not an over-estimate of the share apportioned to each of the three
leading scions of the House of the Savoy, composer, librettist, and
manager, during the run of one of their real successes, such, for
example, as was <i>The Mikado</i>. 'Tis a pity Composer <span class="sc">Solomon</span> did
not call Composer <span class="sc">Sullivan</span> to testify to what might be the pecuniary
value of a successful composition. We wish the deserving <span class="sc">Taylor</span>
better luck with the next suit he takes in hand.</p>

<p>Our compliments to Mrs. <span class="sc">Lovett Cameron</span> on <i>A Tragic Blunder</i>.
A blow given by mistake to the wrong person nearly ruins the entire
happiness of several people, but it all comes right at the end of
two vols. from Mrs. <span class="sc">Cameron's</span> pen. It is a nice light entertainment
with which to while away an hour or two.</p>

<p>"I like <i>Richard Escott</i>," says the Baron, laying down the Macmillanitish
one-volume novel of that name written by E. H. <span class="sc">Cooper</span>.
"It is an interesting story, and might be the first of a series similar
to the <i>Rougon Macquart</i> family, as, when this tale finishes, there
are sufficient <i>Escotts</i> alive to carry on the story of their family
through many generations, only, unfortunately, the date of this
story cannot be taken further back than, say, about ten years ago, if
that. To give the family breathing-time, we should require some
stories about the <span class="sc">Escotts</span> under Queen <span class="sc">Anne</span> and the <span class="sc">Georges</span>, and
then we could return to the fortunes of the sons and daughters
the <i>Richard Escott</i>.</p>

<p>"With fear and trembling, yet with a sensation of enjoying
some secret wicked pleasure," quoth the Baron, confidentially,
"I retired with Mr. <span class="sc">Ashby Sterry's</span> <i>Naughty Girl</i> into my
<i>sanctum</i>, which, as its name implies, is just the very place to
which I ought to retire with a young lady bearing such a character."
<i>A Naughty Girl</i> is published in the "Modern Library Series"
brought out by Messrs. <span class="sc">Bliss</span>, <span class="sc">Sands</span>, <span class="sc">and Foster</span>; and how happy
would <span class="sc">Sands</span> be&mdash;run out, of course&mdash;and where would <span class="sc">Foster</span> be
unless foster'd by the other two&mdash;without <span class="sc">Bliss</span>, who makes quite
a little 'eaven below of this Publishing Firm. Blissful must have
been Mr. <span class="sc">Ashby Sterry's</span> state when he wrote so excellent a
Dickensian description, as he has done in the earlier part of this
book, of Boxing Night at Drury Lane, and when he gave a finishing
touch to this story in showing how <i>Beryl</i> and <i>Jack</i> were
brought together in spite of a temporary misunderstanding and
estrangement. "Bravo Pantalaureate of many a frilling poem!
A Happy Christmas to you and your readers!" quoth the warm-hearted

<h3>"'TWAS IN TRAFALGAR"'S THEATRE.</h3>

<p>As in the case of the old farcical play <i>The Three Hunchbacks</i>,
on which an <i>opéra bouffe</i> was founded, and of all plays ancient and
modern depending for their success on the exact physical resemblance
existing between three distinct persons, directly the audience
has grasped the fact, they enter heartily into the humour of the
complications. Now, in <i>Tom, Dick and Harry</i>, the audience,
having once mastered and allowed the given thesis, viz., that
Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Hawtrey</span>,
Mr. <span class="sc">Ernest Percy</span>, and
Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Playfair</span> are
so exactly alike that even
their own wives and sweethearts
are unable to distinguish
one <i>Antipholus</i> from
another <i>Antipholus</i>, and
both or either from a third
<i>Antipholus</i>, then the fun
of the confusion gains
upon them, and Mrs. R.
<span class="sc">Pacheco's</span> three-act farce
at the Trafalgar Square
Theatre gives the spectators
fits, which assume the proportion
of convulsions of
laughter absolutely dangerous
to the safety of various
individuals. For this deponent
can testify to the effect
of the fun of the farce on a
small boy in a box, who
literally jumped with joy&mdash;quite
a little Jack-in-the-Box&mdash;and
in his excitement
would have precipitated
himself into the stalls, but
for the united energies of
the family party, which retained
him amongst them
by sheer force. He had
been less wildly enthusiastic
about <i>Pickwick</i>, owing, perhaps,
to the restraining appearance
of <i>Tommy Bardell</i>, whose presence on the stage the Boy
in the Box might, perhaps, have been inclined to view with
disfavour, though giving a rapturous welcome to Miss <span class="sc">Jessie
Bond's</span> charming impersonation of <i>Mrs. Bardell</i>, to Mr. <span class="sc">Little's</span>
life-like <i>Pickwick</i>, and to Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Hawtrey's</span> sentimental
but sulky <i>Baker</i>. However he made up for any show of envy
towards <i>Tommy</i> by cordially applauding Mr. <span class="sc">Edward Solomon</span>'s
catching melodies, which are not less humourously than skilfully
orchestrated; and his (I am still speaking of the Boy in the
Box) genuine applause throughout the evening quite led that of
the house, and was a real treat to witness, culminating as it did in a
volcanic eruption of irrepressible joy at the conclusion of the second
act of <i>Tom, Dick and Harry</i>. Miss <span class="sc">Vane Featherston</span>, the Misses
<span class="sc">Esmond</span> and <span class="sc">Williams</span>, the ever-clever Miss <span class="sc">Sophie Larkin</span>, in a
difficult part, Mr. W. F. <span class="sc">Hawtrey</span> as <i>Dr. Wagner</i>, the Specialist&mdash;specially
good&mdash;and Mr. <span class="sc">John Beauchamp</span>, who quite revives the
otherwise worn-out peppery stage-Indian General of old Haymarket
and Adelphi farces,&mdash;all do their very best, and, with Mr. C.
<span class="sc">Hawtrey</span>,&mdash;make the piece what it is, a thorough-going success. At

<h3>A MESSAGE FROM THE SEA.</h3>

<h4><i>Father Neptune loquitur</i>:&mdash;</h4>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p>John Bull, my friend, if an ear you'll lend to your true old messmate Neptune,</p>
<p>It may do you good. We are mates in mood, and our hearts have always kept tune.</p>
<p>The Isle that's right, and extremely tight&mdash; which I trust that mayn't mean "groggy"&mdash;</p>
<p>Is our care, old chum! Well, the outlook's rum, and the prospect rather foggy!</p>
<p>Oh! keep on your hair! There's no cause for Scare, though some party men, and papers,</p>
<p>Do their best to raise a new Naval Craze. These be old, old party capers;</p>
<p>For your angry Outs <i>always</i> swell with doubts, whilst the Cocksure Ins, complacent,</p>
<p>Swear that cause for care may be found&mdash; Nowhere, or the parts thereto adjacent.</p>
<p>You are not so green that mere party spleen, and the bogus bosh of boobies,</p>
<p>Can play the fool with your judgment cool; 'tis a richer dower than rubies.</p>
<p>Still a Fleet, old boy, is no party toy, no theme for factious scoffing,</p>
<p>And&mdash;well, <span class="sc">John</span>, I spot a tremendous lot of "furrin'" ships in the offing!</p>
<p>Keep a weather eye upon sea and sky, and I think <span class="sc">John</span>, altogether,</p>
<p>You will deem it right to get all things tight, and prepare for dirty weather.</p>
<p>"Britons never, never," sounds bold and clever; Britannia won't act as "slavey,"</p>
<p>But if "Missus" would keep her "home on the deep," you <i>must</i> keep up a spanking Navy!</p>
<p>Statistics fog, and there's no such bog as the brain of an average Briton</p>
<p>When his Naval Nobs, and Finance Dry Bobs have got their fighting fit on.</p>
<p>They talk great bosh, half their "facts" won't wash, and as to their figures endless,&mdash;</p>
<p>If from stern to stem you could see through <i>them</i> you would <i>have</i> more, <span class="sc">John</span>, and <i>spend</i> less!</p>
<p>A word in your lug! There is no Hum-bug like that of a Naval Oracle,</p>
<p>When he's "out in the wet"; on that you may bet&mdash;ah! an ironclad to a coracle!</p>
<p>He <i>may</i> mean well, but The Truth to tell in a fashion straight and steady,</p>
<p>Without "cavort" or a "list to port," is as hard&mdash;as song to a Neddy!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Johnny</span>, old boy, you must just employ <i>your own wits</i> on this business;</p>
<p>Party debate will addle your pate, <i>ex-parte</i> "facts" bring dizziness.</p>
<p>Look for yourself, and you'll save much pelf, and good value get for your money,</p>
<p>Squelch party fudge, be your own best judge, and you'll floor the croakers, <span class="sc">Johnny</span>!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Still, <span class="sc">Johnny</span> mine, on my breadths of brine, you must keep first place, or perish.</p>
<p>'Tis with that thought you have paid and fought, and that thought you still must cherish.</p>
<p>Better plank down your last half-crown, than lose the Crown <i>I</i> gave you,</p>
<p>Let gold <i>and</i> blood flow in full flood, than let the foe enslave you!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A rhyme, a rhyme for the Christmas time! It may not, <span class="sc">John</span>, sound jolly,</p>
<p>But to pipe and dance <i>whilst your foes advance</i>, were the maddest sort of folly.</p>
<p>With pockets full Peace's pipe to pull, or to sip your grog and slumber,</p>
<p>Is nice; but you'll wake to a huge mistake <i>if your foes your Fleet outnumber</i>!</p>
<p>Get your Fleet, old man, <i>cheap</i> if you can, but at all costs <i>get your Fleet</i>, <span class="sc">John</span>!</p>
<p>Ships, guns and crew more than any two of the foes you are like to meet <span class="sc">John</span>!</p>
<p>Take your old friend's tip, let <i>no</i> chance slip, and be foiled by <i>no</i> pretence, <span class="sc">John</span>;</p>
<p>Keep eye on the foe, build all you know, and big big D the expense, <span class="sc">John</span>!</p>

the disappearance of "Thank
you," and the substitution of
"Thanks" and "Thanks awfully."
Why not? It is but
a revival of the ancient Latin
form "<i>gratias</i>," and surely
plural "Thanks" indicates
indefinitely more thankfulness
than an uneffusive, frigid,
singular "Thank you," signifying
"I thank you." Let us
be Shakspearianly classical, as
in the quotation above given,
and say "Much thanks." So
again, "I am poor in thanks&mdash;but
I thank you." Here the
relative value of the plural
and the singular in thanks is
well brought out.</p>

<h3>"AFTER THE BALL" IN PARIS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">My Dear Mons. Punch</span>,&mdash;I am delighted!
I am overjoyed! Why, your Oxford College
has accepted the challenge of our Racing
Club to play a game of <i>kic bal</i> this month
of December! It is good! It is very good
indeed! It makes cold, so I can not go for to
see the sport.</p>

<p>But permit me, I would propose these rules
in the cause of humanity, for the sake of
civilisation. I give them below. They are
not many:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Proposed Rules for "le jeu de kic bal"
between Oxford College and Racing Club.</i></p>

<p>1. No kickers to approach closer to one
another than six yards distance.</p>

<p>2. The scrimmage to be interdicted. Sergent
de ville to be on guard on the ground to
prevent assaults even of the most trifling
character.</p>

<p>3. Boots not to be worn, but dancing-pumps.</p>

<p>4. The players to wear fur-lined coats, and
to take arm-chairs on the ground for their
comfort.</p>

<p>5. The "kic bal" to be made of inflated
india-rubber, with a hole in the centre,
so that it shall collapse without causing
injury.</p>

<p>6. No game of "kic bal" to last more than
five minutes, and after every game a pause
of one hour to be permitted, so that the
players may have necessary rest and proper
refreshment.</p>

<p>And yet one more suggestion. But this
shall not be a rule but only an offering. I
make you a present of the idea&mdash;so charming&mdash;as
a compliment of the season. Let the
goals be made of Christmas-trees, let the
"kickers" be covered with holly and mistletoe
(like your "Jack-in-the-Green"), and
instead of a brutal, rough, hard, uncomfortable
globe of leather, let the "kic bal" be a
veritable plum pudding!</p>

<p>Your hand! I wish you "Joking Christmas
Amiable New Year." Your friend&mdash;and
brother, "gentlemans ridere,"</p>

<h3>SEASONABLE SAYINGS.</h3>

<p>There is many a slip between
the house and the church on a
frosty morning.</p>

<p>You cannot make a respectable
tradesman out of a grocer who
offers tips to a working-housekeeper.</p>

<p>You may take a dustman's
token to a stingy man's portal,
but you can't get him to give
you a Christmas-box.</p>

<p>A dun in need is a county
court indeed.</p>

<p>It is a long dinner that has no
earning.</p>

<p>People who live in glass houses
should not throw away their
coke and coals.</p>

<p>Deal with the Stores and the
private accounts will look after
themselves.</p>

<p>A penny saved by avoiding
an omnibus is a florin lost by
taking a Hansom cab.</p>

<p>A single swallow never represents
a family Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>Enough is often dearer than
a feast, especially if you take
the last at the house of a friend.</p>

<p>Send an acquaintance an old
card about Christmas on Boxing
Day, and he will return you a
second-hand greeting on the 2nd
of January anent the New Year.</p>

<p>Give credit at Christmas and
you will find you still have
money owing to you at Easter.</p>

<p>Christmas comes but once a
year, and bores for the length
of a century.</p>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, December 11.</i>&mdash;Remarkable testimony
to catholicity of <span class="sc">Dicky Temple's</span> mind that he should just
now have been talking about Siam. Various other topics to the
fore. The Featherstone inquiry; Matabeleland, in which the <span class="sc">Sage
Of Queen Anne's Gate</span> takes unfaltering interest; Betterment,
and, incidentally, the Parish Councils Bill. Only <span class="sc">Temple</span> thinks of
remote, unfriended, solitary Siam. Wants to know when papers
including most recent correspondence will be published? <span class="sc">Edward
Grey</span> taken at a disadvantage. Wasn't thinking of Siam. Just
been looking up map to find out precise situation of Kilia mouth of
the Danube. <span class="sc">Cap'en Tommy Bowles</span> been, so to speak, jumping
down it. Suspects the <span class="sc">Czar</span> of iniquitous intention in this part
of the world. <span class="sc">Czar</span> evidently thought the <span class="sc">Cap'en</span>, being intent on
the education of <span class="sc">Mundella</span> in nautical affairs, would not have time
to keep an eye on the Kilia mouth of the Danube. <span class="sc">Czar</span> knows better
now. So does <span class="sc">Edward Grey</span>. Spent quite an interesting quarter
of an hour with the map, and came at last upon this particular
outlet. Just congratulating himself that, as a rule, British rivers
have only one mouth, when <span class="sc">Temple</span> sprang Siam upon him.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Member for Sark, looking admiringly at
the great historiographer of Parliament, "I never see <span class="sc">Temple</span> on
his legs but I think of <span class="sc">Ovid's</span> epitaph on the parrot. You remember
how it runs in English?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>'I please the fair. So much this stone doth tell.</p>
<p>What more? I talked, and, for a bird, talked well.'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"I have a theory, which, if you had time, I would illustrate by
half-a-dozen examples taken on glancing round the House, that
three out of five human faces have a strong resemblance to some
particular bird. Not that I mean to say <span class="sc">Temple's</span> like a parrot,
except of course inasmuch as he pleases the fair. He is a man of tireless
industry, sound judgment, wide knowledge of affairs and has,
withal, an old-fashioned courtesy of manner not too common in these
days. Still, as I say, when I watch him addressing the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
the parrot's epitaph haunts my memory."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Clause XIII added to Parish Councils Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;To-night <span class="sc">Don't Keir Hardie</span>, having left hands and
face unwashed for an extra day, his hair uncombed for an added
week, put on his worst Sunday suit and presented himself to House
as model working-man, champion of the unemployed. <span class="sc">Don't Keir's</span>
misfortune is that he has not succeeded in recommending himself to
good opinion of other Labour Members. When he moves in House
they move off; consequence is he is left to support of aristocrats
above the gangway. They don't particularly admire <span class="sc">Don't Keir</span>,
his ways or his cause. But, as <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> says, under impression
he is quoting from <span class="sc">Sydney Smith</span>, "any stick will do to beat a dog
with." If <span class="sc">Don't Keir</span> moves Adjournment, and best part of night
can be taken for making speeches, so much delay is interposed in
way of Parish Councils Bill, and by so much is chance bettered of
Government failing in their intention of passing the whole Bill.
Therefore, though other Labour candidates will have nothing to do
with <span class="sc">Don't Keir</span>, there are four hours talk, an odd quarter of an
hour added for a division, and thirty-three Members, chiefly
belonging to the Gentlemen of England, going into Lobby with the
Leader whom <span class="sc">Rowlands</span> distantly alludes to as "The hon. Member
for West 'Am," cunningly conveying by inflection of voice the
impression that the cut is from a hopelessly inferior part.</p>

<p>Debate, on the whole, patchy, with hopeless air of unreality about
it. Nevertheless, worth having, if it were only for speech of
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>. A scholarly philosophic deliverance, striking
unaccustomed note in Parliamentary debate. Pity Mr. G. wasn't
there to hear it. Or perhaps it isn't a pity. If he had been, he
would have found the temptation to reply irresistible; at least
another half hour would have been wasted.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Spirits of good Ministerialists a little damped by
persistent and successful tactics of Opposition. As <span class="sc">Jesse Collings</span>
said just now, with tears in his eyes, they are anxious, above all
things, to see Parish Councils Bill added to Statute Book. Only
they won't let it pass. Twentieth night in Committee; still not
half way through Bill as Clauses count. Been sitting on Saturdays;
shall have Christmas holidays cut down to 25th and
Boxing Day; then begin again, with prospect of more drudgery,
and, when Bill through, and prorogation possible, the new Session
of 1894, young, fresh, and lusty, waiting to be waltzed with. An
infant in arms, looking in on House from peep-hole by glass door,
and finding <span class="sc">Tay Pay</span> on his legs denouncing the Opposition, is
deeply impressed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/300a-900.png"><img src="images/300a-300.png" width="300" height="221" alt="Tay Pay frightens the Child." /></a>
<h4>Tay Pay frightens the Child.</h4></div>

<p>Later, at period of apparent collapse <span class="sc">Haldane</span> happily appears on
scene. Not a man habitually prone to enthusiasm. No sign on his
placid visage of storm-swept soul. Circumstances sometimes stronger
than man. To-day they break away the icy barriers of lethargic
habit. <span class="sc">Haldane</span>, unexpectedly rising from behind the harassed
<span class="sc">Premier</span>, calls upon him to stand firm, resisting all temptations to
surrender. "Stage of situation reached," he said, amid ringing
cheers, "when we should not halt, much less retire, but should
press forward to the goal. Ministers," he added, sternly regarding
back of <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood's</span> head, "would be betraying their
trust if they flinched by one hair's breadth from the declarations
they have made."</p>

<p>His clarion voice cleared air of doubt and perplexity. Ministerialists
elate; Opposition correspondingly cowed; the way quite
clear now for victory; only sit tight; to importunity present imperturbability;
let Opposition once know that, thanks to fidelity
and self-sacrifice of Liberal Members, House will sit till Bill is
passed, and obstruction will collapse.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Haldane</span> had saved the citadel; the rout of the besiegers only a
matter of time.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/300b-440.png"><img src="images/300b-150.png" width="150" height="260" alt="Sir Richard Parrot." /></a>
<h4>Sir Richard Parrot.</h4></div>

<p>An hour later <span class="sc">Walter Long</span> got up and mentioned interesting
circumstance that <span class="sc">Haldane</span>, whilst
thus heroically inciting Ministers
and the rest to hold on, had made
arrangements whereby he himself
would agreeably spend Christmastide
in comfortable country quarters;
had even extended his holiday up
to 10th of January, when resumption
of sittings of court would bring
him back to town for private business.
Many inquiries on Ministerial
benches for <span class="sc">Haldane</span>. Seemed to
be general desire to say something
to him. But he had judiciously
retired from scene.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Another motion
for Adjournment. In smaller half
of sitting left for business, Clause
XVIII. of Parish Councils Bill
reached.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Everyone grieved to hear
that <span class="sc">Speaker</span> has temporarily lost
use of voice. Been absent from
Chair since Tuesday. "How inscrutable
are the ways of Providence,"
says the Member for Sark. "There
are so many quarters of the House where the outbreak of such an
epidemic would be a public service. Yet these escape, and only the
Chair is attacked."</p>

<p>The House can ill spare the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, even for a day. The whole
atmosphere of the place, the tone of debate, are altered when his
stately presence and commanding influence are withdrawn. Still,
talk must go on, and there has been no lack of it to-night. But
everyone is wearied to death of the monotony and reiteration. As
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> says in a moment of confidence, "If it were the
only alternative, one would rather have a parish funeral than another
Parish Councils Bill."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Nothing worth speaking of.</p>

<h2>THE COUNTY COUNCIL'S PROGRESSIVE PROGRAMME.</h2>

<p>Rise at seven. Called by public bell rung at the nearest fire-brigade
station. Light gas supplied from the Council's works at
Beckton. Drink glass of cold water from Council's new reservoir in
the Kennet Valley. Hurriedly slip into clothes made by gentlemen
working an eight hours day at not less than sixpence an hour.</p>

<p>Fish for breakfast bought at Council's Billingsgate Market; eggs
from Council's hens (warranted <i>very fresh</i>); also fruit from Covent
Garden sold by Council's salesmen. We keep no servants, being
now obliged to use their wages to pay rates. Compelled to open
the front door myself. Surveyor of Chimneys, acting on instructions
(received from sweep), calls to examine flues. Reports them foul, and
notes me in his summons book. Council's revenue inspector
(Inland Revenue absorbed) peeping through half-opened breakfast-room
door, spies what my children call "a duck on stilts" engraved
on a fork. Reports me at once for not having a license to use armorial
bearings. Find in letter-box notice of compulsory purchase by
Council for "allotment purposes" of a choice piece of land belonging
to me just on border of county. Am privately informed that
Radical Labourers' League have moved half-a-dozen good-for-nothing
drunken chaps to apply for allotments! Mine is the only
land that will suit them, and they intend to take it whether I
like it or no.</p>

<p>Just starting for the City, when Council's Architect calls, to draw
my attention to a sky-sign insufficiently secured to an upper window.
It turned out to be eldest boy's socks, hung there to dry, as
we have now to wash at home, or send to the Council's laundries
which are relief-works for those usually unemployed in winter.
Other casuals have turned barbers. I am shaved by one every
morning, after slipping the coppers into a County Council
"detector," which gives no change. In street, find the pavement
up, "unemployed" engaged in moving "immovable objects by
irresistible force," <i>i.e.</i>, a frozen road, at three shillings per cube
foot; Council their own contractors. Tram at last, with Council-driver,
conductor, and horses (all tramways absorbed), and then a
penny Council steamer (Thames Conservancy and Steamboat Companies
absorbed), and, having landed at St. Paul's Pier, trip over
a hole in the road. Bring action against Council for damaged
ankle. (N.B. Lost it later on. Council not liable for non-reparation
of holes.)</p>

<p>At the Guildhall, find Labour Arbitration Court sitting. City and
County been amalgamated, huge coalheavers, dockers, and others
occupy seats of city fathers. Police outside useless. Their helmets
and truncheons in British Museum as relics of Barbarous Age.</p>

<p>Having business at a suburban town I hire cab (Council
Number 23,351) and drive to Liverpool Street. The progressive
members have bought up Great Eastern Railway within the
county's boundaries, and are working it on their own system&mdash;one
class for all, penny fare, and no return ticket. The guards, ticket-collectors,
porters, and others civil enough, but no trains running, in
consequence of great strike having occurred amongst Council's engine-drivers
and the difficulty is just being settled by arbitration at
Guildhall. The men had struck for <i>want</i> of work and a general
desire for "betterment." Thoughtfully walked back to the office,
and arrived just in time to find an official poring over my ledger.
He hands me his card, "Mr. <span class="sc">Inquisitor</span>, Spring Gardens."
Somerset House being absorbed, he says he "has just called to
ascertain exactly what my income really is," and though I am
perfectly civil (under pains and penalties of "civility bye-laws"),
he tells me I must be "put up" next year. He departs, leaving
front door open.</p>

<p>Got a cup of tea, very poor staff, at the L. C. C. Restaurant.
Walk home. No gas in streets, and the Electric Light (lately
absorbed) gone out. Reached home very weary. Find on table
demand-notes for Poor, Police, Sewers, School Board, Highways,
Gas, Electric Light, Baths, Sanitary, Insanitary, Asylum, Water,
Railway, Cab, Theatre, Market, Sky Sign, Bar and Gates, Tramway,
Prisons, Restaurants, Arbitration, Establishment, Thames Conservancy,
Submerged Tenth, and many other rates. Is life worth
living? Ask the L. C. C.</p>
